    # that wasn't built with sufficient header padding (-headerpad_max_install_names).
    # Homebrew's automatic dylib path relinking fails because the Mach-O header can't
    # accommodate the longer /opt/homebrew paths. Since this is a pre-compiled binary
    # we can't rebuild it, and the tool works fine with its original paths, so we
    # want to either Homebrew's linkage checking to avoid the installation
    # failure or some other way to prevent showing a scary error message that
    # does not impact happy-coder's functionality.
    #
    # For now, we'll just skip Homebrew's linkage checking.
